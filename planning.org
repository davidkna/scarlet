* Scarlet: Colors and Color Spaces For Rust (think of good tagline)
** Color Types
 - RGB
 - RGBA
 - sRGB / different gammas and primaries? idk
 - HSV
 - HSL
 - LAB
 - CIELUV
 - CIE 1931?
 - XYZ
 - Spectral?
** Color Input Formats
 - HTML names
 - HTML hex
 - HTML funcs (e.g., ~rgba(0, 0, 1, 0)~)
 - Full initalizer functions (e.g., ~HSLColor(232, 94, 94)~)
** Color Functions
 - Average /n/ colors in a specified space with weights (e.g., avg(red, green, blue) in RGB => grey, in HSV => green)
 - Mix (i.e., additively or subtractively superimpose) colors in a given space (e.g., red + blue = fuschia in RGB)
 - Get gradient scales (ranges of colors interpolated in a color space, so in HSV you'd have red -> yellow
   -> green and in RGB you'd have blue -> violet -> purple -> fuchsia)
   - Logarithmic/other kinds as well?
   - Padding?
 - Common colormaps implemented from scratch (cubehelix, jet (shudder), MATLAB ones, rainbow, grayscale)
   - Arbitrary gradients as colormaps
 - Color distances in each color space
 - Color temperature
 - Convert colors in between color spaces
 - Clamp colors within a gamut
 - Get luminance/lightness/luma values (should probably be separate than color conversion to space with luminance)
   - Special convenience function for getting grayscale version of a color?
 - Format to a string (valid HTML format)
 - Individually set coordinates and change color (e.g., ~c.r = 142~)
 - Print to terminal?
